&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So what is “staking”? Allow us to explain it a little... &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Satoshi created cryptocurrencies with fairness in mind. He envisioned a decentralized method for providing secure and anonymous storage and transference of currency that focused on the needs of private individuals of the digital era. This system includes the tracking and verification of the integrity of transaction data by utilizing consumer-grade computer components to perform calculations. To reward users utilizing their hardware to complete this work, and simultaneously control inflation, Satoshi integrated a reward system into this process. This is now known as &amp;quot;mining&amp;quot; or Proof of work (POW). At a set time interval, the system generates and releases new coins to miners.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;POS doesn’t require fancy equipment. Users can utilize very simple laptops or desktops it doesn't use a lot of power and is very easy to set up. You simply install the wallet, place some coins inside it and wait! Now I am sure we can agree that most people can do this very easily.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Netcoin Developers put it to the community, and asked, is this what we want? The response was a resounding YES! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is nothing special you need to do to get staking, all you need to do is simply place coins in your wallet and wait. That is all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The POS system implemented by Netcoin frees users of the need to purchase expensive hardware for their mining operation to remain relevant, but POS offers better security. To provide incentive, we have made a system where users get rewarded more as the amount they stake increases! We are calling it Personal investment rate or PIR for short. PIR works on a sliding scale, so it always benefits you to own more Netcoins! You can set your own interest rate by simply adjusting how many coins you wish to stake!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</string>
